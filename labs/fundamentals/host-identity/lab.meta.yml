summary: >
  Introduce basic IP address assignment and the point of the netmask in simple host communication.

category: fundamentals
subcategory: connectivity

difficulty: 1
estimated_time: 20m

topics:
  - ip
  - subnet-boundaries

prerequisites:
  - basic-layer-2-connectivity

platforms:
  - arista-ceos
  - cisco-iol-l2
  - cisco-iol
  - generic-l2-switch

images:
  - arista cEOS (user-supplied, official vendor download required)
  - labhost-lite (ghcr.io/capncheapo/labhost-lite:1.0.1)

objectives:
  - Understand the IP address and netmask combination
  - Configure a linux host with an IP address

verification:
  - Hosts in the local subnet can ping each other
  - Hosts in the local subnet can not ping a host in another subnet

outcomes:
  - Understand how classful IP addresses are derived
  - Recognize that the host determines the initial direction of packet flow

notes:
  - No configuration changes are needed on the router in this lab
  - This lab focuses on host behavior, not routing protocols
