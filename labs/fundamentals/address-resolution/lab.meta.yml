summary: >
  Introduce some of the fundamental layers in networking and
  describe how routers and switches fit in. Discuss MAC addresses,
  the ARP process, and why switches don't need an IP address to 
  allow hosts to communicate.

category: fundamentals
subcategory: switching

difficulty: 1
estimated_time: 30m

topics:
  - ip
  - mac-address
  - layers
  - arp

prerequisites:
  - basic-connectivity
  - host-identity

platforms:
  - arista-ceos
  - cisco-iol-l2
  - generic-l2-switch

images:
  - arista cEOS (user-supplied, official vendor download required)
  - labhost-lite (ghcr.io/capncheapo/labhost-lite:1.0.1)

objectives:
  - Observe hosts can ping each other without switch configuration
  - Observe the ARP table on pc1 showing the MAC address for pc1 and pc2
  - Observe the MAC address table on sw1 showing MAC addresses and ports for all devices

verification:
  - None

outcomes:
  - Understand the basics of layers in networking
  - Understand the switch does not need an IP address to allow the hosts to forward
  - Understand the makeup of the ARP table
  - Understand the makeup of the MAC address table

notes:
  - No configuration changes are needed on any device in this lab
  - This lab focuses on host behavior, not routing protocols
