summary: >
  Establish basic end-to-end connectivity between two hosts connected
  through a Layer 2 switch by activating interfaces and verifying
  forwarding behavior.

category: fundamentals
subcategory: addressing

difficulty: 1
estimated_time: 15m

topics:
  - layer-2
  - ethernet
  - arp

prerequisites: []

platforms:
  - arista-ceos
  - cisco-iol-l2
  - generic-l2-switch

images:
  - arista cEOS (user-supplied, official vendor download required)
  - labhost-lite (ghcr.io/capncheapo/labhost-lite:1.0.1)

objectives:
  - Bring administratively down switch interfaces into an operational state
  - Verify link status and interface state
  - Confirm Layer 2 forwarding between hosts
  - Validate connectivity using basic network testing tools

verification:
  - Hosts can successfully ping each other
  - Switch interfaces are administratively and operationally up
  - No Layer 3 configuration is required on the switch

outcomes:
  - Understand the difference between administrative and operational state
  - Observe how switches forward traffic with minimal configuration
  - Gain confidence interacting with a network device CLI
  - Reinforce that connectivity starts with links, not protocols

notes:
  - This lab intentionally uses minimal configuration to emphasize fundamentals
  - The same principles apply across most enterprise switching platforms
