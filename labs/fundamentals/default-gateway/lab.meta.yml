summary: >
  Introduce the concept of a default gateway by observing how a host
  handles traffic destined for non-local networks and how a single
  configuration change enables off-subnet communication.

category: fundamentals
subcategory: routing

difficulty: 1
estimated_time: 15m

topics:
  - ip
  - default-gateway
  - host-routing
  - subnet-boundaries

prerequisites:
  - basic-layer-2-connectivity
  - basic-ip-addressing

platforms:
  - arista-ceos
  - cisco-iol-l2
  - generic-l2-switch

images:
  - arista cEOS (user-supplied, official vendor download required)
  - labhost-lite (ghcr.io/capncheapo/labhost-lite:1.0.1)

objectives:
  - Observe host behavior when no default gateway is configured
  - Configure a default gateway on a host
  - Verify connectivity to a non-local destination

verification:
  - Hosts cannot reach off-subnet destinations without a default gateway
  - Hosts can sucessfully reach off-subnet destinations after configuration
  - Host routing table includes a default route

outcomes:
  - Understand the role of the default gateway in IP networking
  - Recognize that routing decisions begin on the host
  - Distinguish between local delivery and forwarded traffic
  - Build intuition for next-hop forwarding

notes:
  - No configuration changes are needed on the router in this lab
  - The router acts only as a forwarding device
  - This lab focuses on host behavior, not routing protocols
