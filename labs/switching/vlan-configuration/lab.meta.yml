summary: >
  Place groups of hosts into compartmentalized areas of the switch where they can talk to each
  other, but not hosts in other areas.

category: switching
subcategory: vlans

difficulty: 1
estimated_time: 30m

topics:
  - layer-2
  - ethernet
  - vlans

prerequisites: []

platforms:
  - arista-ceos
  - cisco-iol-l2
  - generic-l2-switch

images:
  - arista cEOS (user-supplied, official vendor download required)
  - labhost-lite (ghcr.io/capncheapo/labhost-lite:1.0.1)

objectives:
  - Group functional areas by VLAN and decide on a numbering scheme
  - VLAN names should match functional areas
  - Make appropriate configuration changes on the switch
  - Validate connectivity using basic network testing tools

verification:
  - Hosts in one functional area can ping each other
  - Hosts outside of a functional area cannot ping each other

outcomes:
  - Understand how VLANs can isolate groups of devices on a switch  
  - Learn basic switch configuration
  - Reinforce basic testing tools

notes:
  - Layer 3 support has been disabled on this switch and should not be configured
  - The same principles apply across most enterprise switching platforms
